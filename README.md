# DESCRIPTION:

Project Title: Password Strength Analyzer
Internship Program: InternsVeda
Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, zxcvbn.js
Domain: Cybersecurity

The Password Strength Analyzer is an interactive web-based application developed as part of my minor project under the InternsVeda internship. Its primary objective is to help users create secure passwords by analyzing their strength in real time. Weak passwords are a major cause of security breaches, and this project addresses that issue by providing an intuitive and informative tool for end users.

The tool utilizes the powerful zxcvbn.js JavaScript library (developed by Dropbox), which uses advanced pattern-matching and entropy analysis to determine password strength. When a user types a password, the application instantly evaluates its robustness based on various parameters such as length, dictionary word usage, repeated sequences, common patterns, and overall unpredictability.

# CONCLUSION:
The Password Strength Analyzer is a simple yet effective tool for promoting password security awareness. By leveraging modern JavaScript libraries and intuitive UI design, this project demonstrates both my technical skills and my understanding of user-centric development. It has helped me apply practical HTML/CSS/JavaScript concepts while focusing on real-world security needs. This project also highlights the importance of frontend functionality, user feedback, and data validation in web development.
